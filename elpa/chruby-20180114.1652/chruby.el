;;; Attribution :

;; The chruby-change-path function was taken from rvm.el by Yves Senn

;;; Commentary:

;; The chruby function functions like the shell command, pass it the
;; name of a Ruby such as 'ruby-2.3.3' or 'jruby-1.7.2'.
;;
;; e.g.
;;
;; (require 'chruby)
;; (chruby "ruby-2.3.3")
;;
;; see the README for interactive usage.
